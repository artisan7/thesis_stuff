## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* [covid-chestxray-database](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* pandas
* numpy
* jupyterlab (OPTIONAL: used if you want to access the .ipynb files)

After installing Python 3, enter this in the terminal (make sure python is in PATH):
```sh
pip install cv2 pandas numpy jupyterlab
```

## Usage

**For the image masking process**
1. Download the necessary prerequisites. (OpenCV, pandas, numpy, covid-chestxray-database)
2. Make sure the *covid-chestxray-database* directory is inside the *thesis_stuff* directory
3. Run the *distribute_img.py* file. This will generate directories of the equally distributed images assigned to us.
4. Wait and Enjoy? XD

NOTE: Refer to [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-image-segmentation-masks-the-easy-way-dd4d3656dbd1) for the masking process itself.
